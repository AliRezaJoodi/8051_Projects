## 5CH Remote Controller Using ASK RF Module And PT2262 Encoder (FixCode)   
MCU:		AT89S51    
Frequency:     	8MHz (External Crystal)    

Note: This model Used PT2262 for encoder. I know, encoding is easy with coding. and When we have a MCU, this is not justified. But it was my prototype past years.
