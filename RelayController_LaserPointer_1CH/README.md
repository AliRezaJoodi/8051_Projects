## 1CH Relay Controller With A Laser Pointer
There are one relay and two LDR sensors. One of them activates the relay and the other deactivates it.
MCU:		AT89S51    
Frequency:     	11059200MHz (External Crystal)    

Note: It's a easy project with 8051 and was a prototype. Although this made using microcontroller but, it could be done with logic gates.  
Note: Included schematic and PCB layout with Proteus  
Note: It's a prototype and should get better
